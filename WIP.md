# Work in Progress

This book is a work in progress. What you are reading now is a rough draft with lots of problems and placeholders.

The process of writing in this way is an example of what I call the &ldquo;knowledge loop&rdquo; in the book. The knowledge loop consists of learning, creating and sharing. My writing is based on what I have learned. By sharing early, others can learn from my ideas and I in turn can learn from their feedback.

I know how powerful this approach is from my experience with <a href="http://continuations.com">blogging</a> for the last 8 years. I have learned a great deal from reader comments. The same will be true here. 

You can see some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q--KXVvxPM9NNUdJwi_szRhuA8oeg1ciaggFC7qKBuc/edit?usp=sharing">amazing initial feedback</a>. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time. You can either comment inline via gitbook or email me at <a href="mailto:albert@worldaftercapital.org">albert@worldaftercapital.org</a>.

There is also a separate <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which I will be updating periodically.
