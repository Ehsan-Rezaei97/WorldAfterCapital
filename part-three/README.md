# Part Three: Enhancing Freedom

The second major goal of World After Capital is to propose an approach for overcoming these limits of existing capitalism and an economy based around the Job Loop. Part Three will propose changes to regulation and self-regulation that increase human freedom and let us accelerate the digital knowledge loop. There are three components to this:

1. Economic freedom. We must let everyone meet their basic needs without having to hold a job. This way, we can double down on automation and enable everyone to participate in the knowledge loop.

2. Informational freedom. We must remove boundaries to learning from existing knowledge, creating new knowledge based on what we learn and sharing this new knowledge.

3. Psychological freedom. We must free ourselves from scarcity thinking and its associated fears that impede our participation in the knowledge loop.

Increased individual freedoms are the basis for a smoother transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age. One that is not dictated top down, but results bottom up from individual choices. Later, in Part Four, I will write about values and systems necessary for collective action in a world of increased individual freedom.
