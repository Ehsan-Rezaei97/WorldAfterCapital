# Part Three: Enhancing Freedom

So how do we overcome the limits of existing capitalism to let us accelerate the digital knowledge loop? Part Three will propose changes to regulation and self regulation to increase human freedom. There are three components to this

1. Economic freedom. We must let everyone meet their basic needs without having to hold a job. This way, we can double down on automation and enable everyone to participate in the knowledge loop.

2. Informational freedom We must remove boundaries to learning knowledge, creating new knowledge based on that and sharing this new knowledge.

3. Psychological freedom. We must free ourselves from scarcity thinking and its associated fears that impede our participation in the knowledge loop.
